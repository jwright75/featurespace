Python 3


Total time 1:20 
(the majority spent trying to learn unit testing)
Assumptions made:
	All relevant information relevant to the user is available through this API
Functional requirements:
	Check a user input for a valid UK zipcode
	print country and region for postcode
	list nearest postcode and their countries/regions

thoughts on improvements:
	minimize execution time
	More thorough checking of correct input format
	With more time i could have learned how to properly use the built in python unit test
		-using mock to simulate user input etc
		-i could not get this to work
	
	Improvements on API timeout checks as i dont have much experience with this aspect

Unit test:
	simple edge case test for an empty string
